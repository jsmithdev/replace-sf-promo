# 📱 sf-login-promo-replacement

An LWC page/static site generator to assist replacing Salesforce promo on login

See more about updating login page here: <https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.domain_name_login_branding.htm&type=5>

This project is a fork of: <https://github.com/jsmithdev/app-layout/>

## 👩‍💻 Development

`npm i` to install dependencies

`npm start` to have webpack serve the app and live reload

`npm run build` or `npm run build:dev` to build to /dist

> During build [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) uses the common (prod or dev) [webpack.config.js](./webpack.config.js)

## 🚧 WIP

Feel free to use but I'm still building out the components and documentation
